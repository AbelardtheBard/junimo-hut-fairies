Junimo Hut Fairies Mod
======================

Junimo Hut Fairies Mod adds magical fairy companions to your Stardew Valley farm. Fairies roam around Junimo Huts, bringing life and atmosphere to your fields. The mod also enhances the Crop Fairy event, letting you influence both the chance and the target of the event through in-game actions. All features are globally configurable and work across all save files.

Features
--------
- Fairy Companions: Store the Fairy Box trinket in a Junimo Hut to summon a fairy. Up to 8 fairies can be spawned per hut (configurable up to 36).
- Enhanced Crop Fairy Event:
    * Global Boost: Each Fairy Box in a Junimo Hut adds a configurable percentage to the nightly Crop Fairy event chance (default: +0.1% per box, max 8 boxes = +0.8% total). Use -1 for unlimited boxes.
    * Local Boost: When the Crop Fairy event triggers, each crop within 8 tiles of a Junimo Hut gets weight bonus per Fairy Box in that hut (default: +1 weight per box, up to 36 boxes max).
- Simple Fairy Styles: Choose from 8 different fairy appearance styles (1-8). Each has a unique look and color.
- Global Configuration: All settings apply to every save file and can be changed via the in-game config menu (requires Generic Mod Config Menu).
